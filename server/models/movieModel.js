// This is a placeholder for your data model.
// In a real application, you would use an ORM like Mongoose or Sequelize
// to define the schema for your 'Movie' collection/table.

/*
Example with Mongoose:
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const movieSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: String,
  genre: String,
  year: Number,
  posterUrl: String,
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Movie', movieSchema);
*/

console.log('Movie model loaded (placeholder).');
